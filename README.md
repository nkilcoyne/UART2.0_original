This project is for the Gamecock Grand Prix 2021 vehicle dashboard. The original
idea was for the car was going to run in the Formula SAE-E North competition in 
Canada. However due to COVID-19 and bugetting issues, we decided this was not a
wise decision since this is our very first time building a car from the ground up.

Current Status as of 4/9/2021: The dashboard is currently in progress with various
gauges being updated as a testing loop runs through numerical values of 1 to 20.
It also will display a 16 character CAN message array. However, there is no
functionality with the CAN messages to the dashboard components yet.
